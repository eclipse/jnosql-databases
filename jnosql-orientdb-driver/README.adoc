*Orientdb*: OrientDB is an open source NoSQL database management system written in Java. It is a multi-model database, supporting graph, document, key/value, and object models, but the relationships are managed as in graph databases with direct connections between records. It supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes. It has a strong security profiling system based on users and roles and supports querying with Gremlin along with SQL extended for graph traversal. OrientDB uses several indexing mechanisms based on B-tree and Extendible hashing, the last one is known as "hash index", there are plans to implement LSM-tree and Fractal tree index based indexes. Each record has Surrogate key which indicates position of record inside of Array list , links between records are stored either as single value of record's position stored inside of referrer or as B-tree of record positions (so-called record IDs or RIDs) which allows fast traversal (with O(1) complexity) of one-to-many relationships and fast addition/removal of new links. OrientDB is the second most popular graph database according to the DB-Engines graph database ranking


=== How To Install

Once this a communication layer to Orientdb, we're using integration test, so you need to install Orientdb. The recommended way is using Docker.

1. Install docker: https://www.docker.com/
2. https://store.docker.com/images/orientdb
3. Run docker command
4. `docker run -d --name orientdb -p 2424:2424 -p 2480:2480 -e ORIENTDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpwd orientdb`
5. Execute the maven install `mvn clean install`


=== Install without testing


If you won't run the tests the database is not required, so just run the maven skipping the tests.

1. Execute the test `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
