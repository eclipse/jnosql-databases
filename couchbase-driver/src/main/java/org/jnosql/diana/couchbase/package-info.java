/**
 *  Couchbase Server, originally known as Membase, is an open-source, distributed (shared-nothing architecture)
 *  multi-model NoSQL document-oriented database software package that is optimized for interactive applications.
 *  These applications may serve many concurrent users by creating, storing, retrieving, aggregating, manipulating and
 *  presenting data. In support of these kinds of application needs, Couchbase Server is designed to provide
 *  easy-to-scale key-value or JSON document access with low latency and high sustained throughput. It is designed
 *  to be clustered from a single machine to very large-scale deployments spanning many machines.
 *  A version originally called Couchbase Lite was later marketed as Couchbase Mobile combined with other software.
