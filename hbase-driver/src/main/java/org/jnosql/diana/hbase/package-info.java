/**
 * HBase is an open source, non-relational, distributed database modeled after Google's BigTable and is written in Java.
 * It is developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Apache Hadoop project and runs on top of HDFS
 * (Hadoop Distributed File System), providing BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop. That is, it provides a
 * fault-tolerant way of storing large quantities of sparse data (small amounts of information caught within a large
 * collection of empty or unimportant data, such as finding the 50 largest items in a group of 2 billion records, or
 * finding the non-zero items representing less than 0.1% of a huge collection).
